  <h1> What is this game?</h1>
  <p>
This is my final project for my first java course in the first semester of univeristy. It's game based on the manhwa "SoloLeveling", it's not a long game but I used all of the techniques taught to me in my first semster and im honeslty pretty proud of it.

  If I invested a bit more time into it im sure it could of been better but I just wanted to post this for people who are about to start univeristy for computer science to show them what you learn by the end of the the first semester :)
     any questions feel free to message me!
